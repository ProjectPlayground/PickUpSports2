## Vision
This application is designed to synchronize the athletic events of friends and neighbors by promoting helpful communication specifically pertaining to the timing, location, and attendence of the event. Users should be able to sign up with an account and link with their friends so that they may be able to create events for people to attend, either publically or privately, and attend other people's events. 

By providing this central interface for communication tailored specifically for sporting events, I hope to allow amateur sport teams and individuals to involve themselves more easily in the world. Ideally, users should be able to see the activities of others in their area and join in with new people who share similar interests through the ever challenging medium of athletic competition.
