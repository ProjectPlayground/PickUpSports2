# PickupSports2
## Vision
Many students around the world participate in collegiate athletics or intramural sports. Time spent exercising with friends and classmates assists in developing healthy habits and behaviors, while promoting camaraderie and friendship. However, after school ends, it often becomes difficult to find activities and people to play sports with, and this cornerstone of many young peopleâ€™s lives tends to fall by the wayside. 

This application is designed to synchronize the athletic events of friends and neighbors by promoting helpful communication specifically pertaining to the timing, location, and attendance of an event. Users should be able to sign up with an account and link with their friends so that they may be able to create athletic events for people to attend, either publically or privately, and attend other people's events.

By providing this central interface for communication tailored specifically for sporting events, this application will allow amateur sport teams and individuals to involve themselves more easily in the world around them. Ideally, users should be able to see the activities of others in their area and join in with new people who share similar interests through the ever-challenging medium of athletic competition.
